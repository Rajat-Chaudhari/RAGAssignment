# RAGAssignment
There are three fundamental parts which are very important to an llm based solution
1. The Vectors and how efficiently they are indexed
2. the LLMs themselves on how they manage the context and give refined output
3. The infrastructure which hosts the entire system

These three points must be the focal point in determining any system architecture for gen AI based applications or use cases
The infrastrucutre is critical since the models are very huge and this brings distinct operational challenges apart from the application architecture to the overall system.
Please refer the System Architecture diagram in repo for a high level view
